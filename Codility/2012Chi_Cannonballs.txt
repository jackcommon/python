A new kind of cannon is being tested. The cannon shoots cannonballs in a fixed direction. Each cannonball flies horizontally until it hits the ground, and then it rests there. Cannonballs are shot from different heights, so they hit the ground at different points.
You are given two zero-indexed arrays, A and B, containing M and N integers respectively. Array A describes the landscape in the direction along with the cannon is shooting. Elements of array A represent the height of the groud, going from the cannon outwards. Array B contains levels from which consecutive cannonballs are shot.
Assume that a cannonball is shot at level H.
    . Let I be the smallest index, such that 0 < I < M and A[I] >= H. The cannonball falls at position I - 1 and increase the ground level A[I-1] by 1.
    . If there is no such I, and H > A[I] for all <= I < M, then the cannonball flies beyond the horizon and has no effect on the result.
    . If H <= A[0], then the cannonball ricochets away and has no effect on the result either.
Write a function:
    def solution(A, B)
that, given arrays A and B, simulates the flight of the cannonballs and returns
